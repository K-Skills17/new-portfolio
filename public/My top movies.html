 <h1>The Best Animes According To Stephen</h1>
 <h2>My Top 5 Amines Of All Time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>5. Attack On Titan</h3>
 <p>The story line is a little confusing but the animation is awesome and you have to pay extra attention to understant what is going on in the series</p>
 <h4>My Favorite Characters</h4>
 - Eren Yeager <br />
 - Levi Ackerman <br />
 <i><b><p>It is an anime i will watch again and again if i had the time to do so.</i></b></p>
 <h3>4. Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
 <p>The character development and the powers in this series are top notch. The animation is in a world of its own.</p>
 <p> However I think the writers made Gojo so famous that he outshines the main character</p>
 <h4>My Favorite Characters</h4>
 - Saturo Gojo<br />
 - Ryomen Sukuna<br />
 - Yuji Itadori<br />
 <i><b><p>I have already watched this anime more than one time and I would absolutely go back to watch again. Even if just the fight scenes which i consider amazing.</b></i></p>
